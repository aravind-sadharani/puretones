        <h1>Indian Musical Scales</h1>
        <p>In an <a href="/tuningsystems/">earlier article</a>, we reconstructed two historically significant tuning systems which were used in Indian Classical music:</p>
        <ol class="textlist">
            <li>The 22 note division of an octave described by <strong>Bharat</strong> and later by <strong>Sarang Dev</strong>.</li>
            <li>The 12 note division of an octave described by <strong>Ramamatya</strong> and <strong>Venkatamakhin</strong>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Depending on your knowledge of Indian Classical music, you may have some familiarity with these two tuning systems. If you are completely unaware of them, then it may be a good idea to read <a href="/tuningsystems/">that article</a> first.</p>
        <p>But an important question that remains unanswered is regarding the relevance of those tuning systems to Indian musical scales and Ragas <em>today</em>. Are there scales and Ragas which still use the same tuning as we reconstructed? Or have these tuning systems and their derivative Jatis and Ragas left a more subtle imprint on today's music?</p>
        <p>Let us tackle this question using the very same scale with which we began the previous article, i.e., the <em>Sama Gana scale</em>. If we simply write down its notes, it goes as follows:</p>

        <br>
        <center><strong>Sa Re ga ma Pa Dha ni</strong></center>
        <br>

        <p>where a note beginning with an upper case letter is a sharp (tivra) note, while one beginning with a lower case letter is a flat (komal) note. Depending on your familiarity with Indian Classical music, you may relate it to the <em>Raga Kharaharapriya</em> as well as the <em>Raga Kafi</em>. Of course, from the previous article, we know it also corresponds to the <em>Shadaj Gram scale</em>.</p>
            
        <p>How is it that Sama Gana scale, Shadaj Gram, Kharaharapriya and Kafi can all be denoted the same way and yet be considered different? We know from the <a href="/tuningsystems/">previous article</a> that Sama Gana scale and Shadaj Gram have a slight difference in the tuning of <strong>Re</strong> and <strong>Dha</strong>. In the case of Kharaharapriya and Kafi, their distinction in terms of musical patterns and phrases is well accepted and should be recognisable to an attentive patron of Indian Classical music. But in terms of the tuning of these Ragas, there is no formal documentation.</p>

        <h2>Demonstrations of Sama Gana scale and its variants</h2>
        <p>Before we analyse this further, here is a series of samples expressing each of these scales musically. Listen to them and see if they sound similar or different, and in what way.</p>

        <p>First, we present a musical interpretation of the Sama Gana scale. As the prevalent instrument of the Sama Gana era was likely to be a harp, we present a composition with very minimal use of shakes or bends of notes.</p>

        <p>Next, we present the same scale but interpreted with a more liberal use of bends and shakes.</p>

        <br>

        <p>Raga Kharaharapriya and Raga Kafi are quite well represented in the vast of body of work of Indian Classical music. Here are a few examples of really great renditions of these Ragas:</p>

        <ul class="textlist">
            <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJgyltmRuSA" target="_blank">Raga Kharaharapriya by M D Ramanathan, Lalgudi Jayaraman and Umayalpuram K Sivaraman</a>: The recording is a bit old and sounds like it has been extracted from a cassette tape, but the music is well worth the listen. The tanpura player is uncredited.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCZvTbVN-aw" target="_blank">Raga Kharaharapriya by Emani Sankara Sastry and M S Gopalakrishnan</a>: This is a full length Ragam Tanam Pallavi concert and also an old recording. The mridangam and tanpura players are uncredited.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHiGrt0WbxE" target="_blank">Raga Kafi Ki Hori by Ustad Nasir Aminuddin Dagar and Ustad Nasir Moinuddin Dagar</a>: This is Raga Kafi in a semi-classical Hori format accompanied by Sarangi, Pakhawaj and Tanpura. The instrumentalists are uncredited.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuwhAGlS0-E" target="_blank">Raga Kafi by Pandit Pushparaj Koshti</a>: This is a full length concert with an Alapana and a Dhamaar. Sanjay Agle and Marianne Svasek provide accompaniment on the Pakhawaj and the Tanpura.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>What do you think? Did you find the four scales/Ragas to be similar or different? You may want to listen to them a few more times, and we encourage you to take your time to absorb and appreciate each of these different pieces. Depending on your familiarity with Indian Classical music and the acuity of your pitch perception, you should find them distinct at different levels. You may intuitively feel they are different or you may know exactly which notes or phrases are rendered differently.</p>

        <p>In any case, if you are curious to learn more about how they are different and how those differences tie in with the evolution of Indian Classical music, its tuning systems and musical scales, then let us continue.</p>

        <h2>Historical milestones in Indian Classical Music</h2>
        <p>In order to understand how Indian tuning systems and musical scales developed and evolved into today's music, it is necessary to trace the history of Indian Classical music through various eras and milestones. Note that the following material is not intended to be an authoritative and accurate historical commentary. Rather please read it as a broad account of the different eras through which Indian Classical music progressed and transformed into its modern form. Also note that folk music or generally, forms of music which were not subjected to the rigours of scriptures and grammar, were always around and continued to evolve in parallel while both inflencing and drawing from classical music.</p>

        <h3>From 1200 BCE to 200 CE: Sama Gana and Gandharva Veda</h3>
        <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaveda">Samaveda</a> can be regarded as the origin of classical or scripture based music in India. The chanting of the literature of Sama Veda was termed as Sama Gana (i.e., the singing of Sama Veda). Sama Gana was performed in accordance with a musical scale which was derived using the concept of Pancham bhav (fifth) and Madhyam bhav (fourth). For more details, refer to <a href="/tuningsystems/">this article</a>. Over time, the musical scriptures branched off and evolved into their own <em>Upaveda</em> (a subsidiary vedic text) called <em>Gandharva Veda</em>. The Sama Gana scale survived from nearly a thousand years eventually giving way to Shadaj Gram.</p>

        <p class="notice "><strong>Note:</strong> Under the influence of the Sama Gana scale, it is likely that early musical works retained the scale and its intervals and worked with them. The composition we presented in Demo 1 is an artistic recollection of such a proto-typical work of music.</p>

        <h3>From 200 CE to 1200 CE: 22 Shruti tuning system</h3>
        <p>Sometime in the period from 200 BCE to 200 CE, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharata_Muni">Bharat</a> document the performing arts traditions and knowledge of his contemporary India in his famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natya_Shastra">Natya Shastra</a>. Bharat describes a tuning system called Shadaj Gram which can be considered as a slight modification of the Sama Gana scale. For more details, refer to <a href="/tuningsystems/">this article</a>. In this period, music was likely played in accompaniment with 8 string harps tuned to Shadaj Gram and its related scales. Over a period of time, more sophisticated instruments came into being adding the capabilities of bends, slides and shakes of notes to Indian Classical music. But the 22 shruti tuning system based on Shadaj Gram remained the standard. Through its murchhanas, jatis and lakshanas, this era created a legacy and precedent for Raga bhavs and identities.</p>

        <p class="notice "><strong>Note:</strong> With the invention of new instruments with the capability to slide or modulate notes with frets, the musical thinking must have definitely evolved. The compositions we presented in Demo 2 and Demo 3 are an artistic recollection of how music evolved and became more sophisticated in this period.</p>

        <h3>1200 CE to 1600 CE: Acceptance of Adhara Shadaj</h3>
        <p>The music in the era of Shadaj Gram was based on murchhanas and jatis. Essentially, these were musical structures based on cyclical permutations of the Shadaj Gram scale. As the capabilities of musical instruments improved with slide and fretted instruments coming in, Indian Classical music underwent a profound transition, adopting the concept of Adhara Shadaj or singing to a fixed tonic (Sa). Musicians grappled with mapping older concepts to the new framework. In this process, the musicians of this era laid down the precedents for modern Ragas and their associated Raga bhavs. It is likely that this period saw the emergence of some early versions of the 12 note tuning system which was later formalised by Ramamatya.</p>

        <h3>1600 CE: 12 note tuning system</h3>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svaramelakalanidhi">Ramamatya</a> prescribed a method for setting the frets on a Sudha Mela veena. This resulted in a 12 note tuning system documented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venkatamakhin">Venkatamakhin</a> which is also equivalent to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_tuning">Pythagorean Tuning</a> system. When notes are played on the fret positions, then they would naturally be in accordance with the 12 note tuning system. So any vocalists or instrumentalists playing in accompaniment with a veena would naturally have to adhere to this tuning system to be in tune. Any conscious deviations, to evoke shades of notes not available in this tuning system, would have required the deliberate use of bends and shakes which were well understood by the veena player and his accompanying musicians. In this way, this tuning system together with Adhara Shadaj partly honoured the legacy of the 22 Shruti tuning system and Jatis derived from it. But it also moulded the same legacy into a form which is more familiar to us today.</p>

        <h3>1600 CE to 1700 CE: Tanpura as the Tuning System</h3>
        <p>The Tanpura as a musical instrument is likely to have reached its modern form sometime around 1700 CE. The use of a rounded bridge to create a richer sound was already employed in Veenas. This was incorporated in the Tanpura, along with the ingenious idea of a cotton thread inserted between the strings and the bridge. As we describe in a <a href="/tanpuraworking/">later article</a>, in a Tanpura, the clever design of the bridge and the thread, allows us to split the harmonics of each string and hear them separately. Much like a prism splitting white light into its constituent rainbow colours, the bridge and thread of the Tanpura split apart the harmonics of each string. For example, from the <strong>Sa</strong> string of a Tanpura, harmonics corresponding to <strong>Pa</strong>, <strong>Ga</strong>, etc can be heard, while from the <strong>Pa</strong> string <strong>Re</strong>, <strong>Ni</strong>, etc can be heard. Thus, a Tanpura creates a tuning system where certain positions in the octave are better supported and certain positions are perceived as dissonant. By subtly adjusting the tuning of each Tanpura string, it can be tuned to support the Sama Gana scale or the Shadaj Gram scale or any other musical scale of choice. Each distinct tuning encourages or discourages certain Ragas. This aspect along with Adhara Shadaj further moulded the legacy of Raga identities.</p>

        <p class="notice "><strong>Note:</strong> In each of the Demos 1-3, you may have noticed the Tanpura (drone) track playing in the background. In Demo 1 and 2, the Tanpura was tuned to ensure the tuning system generated by the Tanpura was consistent with the Sama Gana scale. In Demo 3, the Tanpura was tuned differently to match the Shadaj Gram scale. Please do check the demos again with this understanding in mind.</p>

        <h3>1200 CE to 1800 CE: Slow and progressive divergence of Hindustani and Carnatic classical music</h3>
        <p>During the same period when Adhara Shadaj, the 12 note tuning system and then Tanpura was adopted by Indian Classical music, there was a slow and progressive divergence between Hindustani and Carnatic classical music. It is believed that by 1800 CE or so, the two were considered sufficiently distinct at an aesthetic and stylistic level. These differences arose primarily out of localized clusters of musicians formed around the courts and estates of their royal and noble patrons. However, it is important to underscore the point that they shared this critical period of change in the history of Indian Classical music, when the music changed from a harp based tuning system to a fret based one and then ultimately to an overtone based tuning system. So despite their overt differences, Hindustani and Carnatic music share very deep roots.</p>

        <h3>1800 CE to 1900 CE: Introduction and acceptance of Harmonium</h3>
        <p>The harmonium was introduced around 1800 CE and became quite accepted among several communities of musicians by around 1900 CE. The harmonium brought with it the Western <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_equal_temperament">12 tone equal temperament</a> tuning to Indian music and this further moulded Raga identities. The tuning system of the harmonium is similar and also different from that of a fret based veena. On a fretted veena, by the use of bends and shakes, it is possible to avoid or evoke certain shades of notes as required. A harmonium being restricted to fixed notes constrains the player and accompanying artists in terms of the musical phrases they can execute while still playing in tune. Owing to its tuning system, the harmonium made Indian melodies directly comparable and relatable to the Western musical concepts of scales and modes. This also enhanced its popularity in popular and film music.</p>

        <h2>Role of Tuning Systems in Raga identity</h2>
        <p>Let us revisit the question which we posed at the beginning of this article. How are the different tuning systems of the past relevant to Indian musical scales and Ragas <em>today</em>? Based on the long history and evolution of Indian Classical music, it is fair to say that the tuning systems and their derivative Jatis and Ragas have definitely left an imprint on today's music, even though we may no longer use historical tuning systems exactly as they were.</p>

        <p>Truth be told, there are only two tuning systems in use in Indian music today: 12 tone equal temperament and the tuning system defined by the Tanpura. Unlike the former, the latter is not a single tuning system but a family of tunings each subtly different from the other depending how the individual strings of a Tanpura are tuned. Together with the musical legacy of Ragas passed on over thousands of years, a Tanpura tuned by a skilled artist can evoke the feeling of the chosen Raga so well that its identity is unmistakeable.</p>

        <p>In a <a href="/tanpuraworking/">later article</a>, we will address Tanpura tuning a bit more closely and shed more light on how the drone track in Demos 1 and 2 differs from that in Demo 3.</p>
