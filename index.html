    <h2>What is PureTones?</h2>

    <p>PureTones is an exploration of Indian Classical music to understand the role of harmonics, microtones and consonance in Indian music and musical scales. Our first project is the PureTones Drone which is a digital emulation of the  <em>Tanpura</em> (a drone instrument used in Indian Classical music). If this sounds interesting to you, check out some of our work below.</p>

    <h2>Experience PureTones</h2>

    <p>Here are three recordings to showcase the sound of the PureTones drone.</p>

        <h3>PureTones Drone for Raga Komal Rishabh Asavari</h3>
        <p>Start by listening to the PureTones drone accompaniment which has been fine tuned to suit <em>Raga Komal Rishabh Asavari</em>. The drone track by itself may or may not suggest Raga Komal Rishabh Asavari to you.</p>

        <h3>Signature Tune in Raga Komal Rishabh Asavari</h3>
        <p>Now listen to a short motif in Raga Komal Rishabh Asavari with the PureTones drone accompaniment in the background. How well do you think the motif matches with the drone?</p>

        <h3>Raga Alapana in Raga Komal Rishabh Asavari on Chandraveena</h3>
        <p>The signature tune is just a simple example. But now listen to S Balachander perform a Raga Alapana in Raga Komal Rishabh Asavari with the PureTones drone accompaniment in the background. </p>

    <h2>PureTones Audio and Video Channels</h2>

    <p>If these recordings sounded interesting to you, then please check out our <span class="youtubespan"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGkhen1YJk-c_O4361csmaQ/">YouTube channel</a></span> and <span class="bandcampspan"><a href="https://puretones.bandcamp.com">Bandcamp page</a></span> for more.</p>

    <p>We periodically release works from PureTones in the form of synthesized tracks. These tracks feature both the drone accompaniment as well as patterns and motifs in the supported scales so that you can experience and judge the musical consonance for yourselves.</p>

    <p>We feature several different tunings supporting different musical scales to give you an idea of the scope and scale of this tool. We also feature recordings of live performances using PureTones, featuring S Balachander on <span class="chandraveenaspan"><a href="https://www.chandraveena.com">Chandraveena</a></span>, to showcase the tool in a live music setting.</p>

    <h2>How PureTones started</h2>

    <p>The idea of PureTones originates from our investigation to understand the workings and the musical potential of the Tanpura. Any fan, student or artist of Indian Classical music knows how the resonant and calming tones emitted by the Tanpura provide a rich atmosphere which encourages music, and also supports the reference note, <strong>Sa</strong>.</p>

    <p>A typical Tanpura has 4 strings often tuned as <strong>Pa SA SA Sa</strong> with <strong>Sa</strong> representing the fundamental, <strong>Pa</strong> the fifth and <strong>SA</strong> the octave. The use of a rounded bridge and a cotton thread inserted between the string and the bridge, causes the contact point of the vibrating string to keep shifting subtly. This makes the Tanpura emit a dispersion of overtones from each string (akin to a prism splitting white light into a rainbow).</p>

    <p>An expert artist can finely tune the strings to enable the selected Raga to seamlessly blend in, to the harmonic envelope of the Tanpura. PureTones aims to explore and emulate this capability.</p>

    <p>If you are interested to learn how a Tanpura works and how PureTones emulates the harmonic envelope of a Tanpura, please check out <a href="/story">The Story of PureTones</a>.</p>

    <h2>Support PureTones</h2>

    <p>The PureTones drone and other tools are under development. The recordings above have been synthesized from a development version. We are eager to bring these tools to the music community. Please help us to do so, by giving your valuable time to listen to these tracks and leave your feedback. If you like the quality of these tracks, please consider supporting our development efforts by purchasing our tracks on <span class=bandcampspan><a href="https://puretones.bandcamp.com">Bandcamp</a></span>.</p>

    <p>If you are a music student with a request for a specific scale tuned at a specific pitch, please get in touch. If you are a musician and wish to evaluate and record with the PureTones drone, again, please get in touch.</p>
