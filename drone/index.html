    <h1>PureTones Drone</h1>
    <p>PureTones Drone is a digital Tanpura with controls for fine tuning the strings and adjusting their harmonic envelope. PureTones Drone has been developed using <a href="https://faust.grame.fr/">Faust</a>, a functional programming language for sound synthesis and audio processing. This enables skilled Indian Classical musicians to fine tune the harmonic envelope to suit whichever Raga they wish to perform or practice.</p>
    <p>Contrary to widely held perceptions, the Tanpura is not only responsible for providing a reference of the fundamental note <strong>Sa</strong>, but it actually provides a tuning system resulting from string overtones which supports the entire Raga being performed. To understand this better, read <a href="/tanpuraworking/">this article</a> which illustrates the role of the Tanpura in Indian Classical music.</p>
